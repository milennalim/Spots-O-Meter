Spots-O-Meter
=============

Count the number for spots in your image! Download and extract the .zip file, then run spotsometer.exe.

STEP 1: Upload a 640x480 BMP image file.

STEP 2: If the background color is darker than the color of the spots, click "Invert Image".

STEP 3: Now it's time to convert the image to black-and-white. Adjust the black-and-white threshold according to the greyscale distribution graph on the right, so that the spots are mostly darker than the threshold and the background is mostly lighter.

STEP 4: Any spot whose area is greater than the green circle and less than the red circle will be counter. Adjust the maximum and minimum sizes accordingly, using the slider bars at the bottom.

STEP 5 (optional): TO measure the area of the spots, upload an image representing 10 cm in the scale of the spots image (ex. a photo of a ruler, taken using the same setup as the photo od the spots). Select two endpoints which are 10 cm appart.

STEP 6: Click "Measure Spots". All spots which are counted has white dots marked at the centre.
